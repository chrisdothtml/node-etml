etml is a NodeJS-built HTML enhancer. It was inspired by the way that [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SCSS_FOR_SASS_USERS.html) maintains all the syntax from regular CSS, yet enhances the way you are able to work with it. ETML allows you to work with the HTML syntax you know and love, but provides some enhanced functionality to make development quicker and more efficient.

I built this processor out of my own necessity, and I personally use it on most of my projects. It's the perfect tool for me, but if it's not for you, feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/chrisdothtml/node-etml/issues) and I'll be happy to consider any changes or additions.
